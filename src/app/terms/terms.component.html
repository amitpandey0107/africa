At no time does Zalate take possession or control of the crypto-currencies being offered or the matters of payment involved.</p>

The Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this Agreement to Arbitrate.</p>

UNLESS BOTH YOU AND ZALATE AGREE OTHERWISE, THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE OR JOIN MORE THAN ONE PERSON&#39;S OR PARTY&#39;S CLAIMS, AND MAY NOT OTHERWISE PRESIDE OVER ANY FORM OF A CONSOLIDATED, REPRESENTATIVE, CLASS, OR PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTION OR PROCEEDING. ALSO, THE ARBITRATOR MAY AWARD RELIEF (INCLUDING MONETARY, INJUNCTIVE, AND DECLARATORY RELIEF) ONLY IN FAVOR OF THE INDIVIDUAL PARTY SEEKING RELIEF AND ONLY TO THE EXTENT NECESSARY TO PROVIDE RELIEF NECESSITATED BY THAT PARTY&#39;S INDIVIDUAL CLAIM(S).

All other claims will be arbitrated.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="text-row">
				<a class="bold" style="padding-left: 25px;">2:  &nbsp;&nbsp; Arbitration Procedures</a>
			</div>

			<div class="text-row">
				<p class="normal-text" style="padding-left: 25px;">Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court. Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, and court review of an arbitration award is very limited. However, an arbitrator can award the same damages and relief on an individual basis that a court can award to an individual. An arbitrator should apply the terms of the User Agreement as a court would. All issues are for the arbitrator to decide, except that issues relating to arbitrability, the scope or enforceability of this Agreement to Arbitrate, or the interpretation of Section 1 of this Agreement to Arbitrate (&quot;Prohibition of Class and Representative Actions and Non-Individualized Relief&quot;), shall be for a court of competent jurisdiction to decide. The arbitration will be conducted by the American Arbitration Association (&quot;AAA&quot;) under its rules and procedures, including the AAA&#39;s Consumer Arbitration Rules (as applicable), as modified by this Agreement to Arbitrate. The AAA&#39;s rules are available at www.adr.org or by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879. The use of the word &quot;arbitrator&quot; in this provision shall not be construed to prohibit more than one arbitrator from presiding over an arbitration; rather, the AAA&#39;s rules will govern the number of arbitrators that may preside over an arbitration conducted under this Agreement to Arbitrate. A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send to the other, by certified mail, a completed form Notice of Dispute (&quot;Notice&quot;). You may send a Notice to Zalate which should be sent to Zalate LLC, _____________, Wyoming. Zalate will send any Notice to you to the physical address we have on file associated with your Zalate account; it is your responsibility to keep your physical address up to date. All information called for in the Notice must be provided, including a description of the nature and basis of the claims the party is asserting and the relief sought. If you and Zalate are unable to resolve the claims described in the Notice within 30 days after the Notice is sent, you or Zalate may initiate arbitration proceedings. A form for initiating arbitration proceedings is available on the AAA&#39;s site at www.adr.org. In addition to filing this form with the AAA in accordance with its rules and procedures, the party initiating the arbitration must mail a copy of the completed form to the opposing party. <br><br>The arbitration hearing shall be held in the county in which you reside or at another mutually agreed location. If the value of the relief sought is $10,000 or less, you or Zalate may elect to have the arbitration conducted by telephone or based solely on written submissions, which election shall be binding on you and Zalate subject to the arbitrator&#39;s discretion to require an in-person hearing, if the circumstances warrant. In cases where an in-person hearing is held, you and/or Zalate may attend by telephone, unless the arbitrator requires otherwise. <br><br>The arbitrator will decide the substance of all claims in accordance with applicable law, including recognized principles of equity, and will honor all claims of privilege recognized by law. The arbitrator shall not be bound by rulings in prior arbitrations involving different users but is bound by rulings in prior arbitrations involving the same Zalate user to the extent required by applicable law. The arbitrator&#39;s award shall be final and binding and judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof.</p>

			<div class="text-row">
				<a class="bold" style="padding-left: 25px;">3:  &nbsp;&nbsp; Costs of Arbitration</a>
			</div>

			<div class="text-row">
				<p class="normal-text" style="padding-left: 25px;">Payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA&#39;s rules unless otherwise stated in this Agreement to Arbitrate. If (a) you willfully fail to comply with the Notice of Dispute requirement discussed above, or (b) in the event the arbitrator determines the claim(s) you assert in the arbitration to be frivolous, you agree to reimburse Zalate for all fees associated with the arbitration paid by Zalate on your behalf that you otherwise would be obligated to pay under the AAA&#39;s rules.</p>

			<div class="text-row">
				<a class="bold" style="padding-left: 25px;">4:  &nbsp;&nbsp; Severability</a>
			</div>

			<div class="text-row">
				<p class="normal-text" style="padding-left: 25px;">With the exception of any of the provisions in Section 1 of this Agreement to Arbitrate (&quot;Prohibition of Class and Representative Actions and Non-Individualized Relief&quot;), if an arbitrator or court decides that any part of this Agreement to Arbitrate is invalid or unenforceable, the other parts of this Agreement to Arbitrate shall still apply.</p>
